DESCRIPTION:
This is a basic (very) client server program developed in c that useS socket programming (ofcourse :p) for commuting in between the client and the server.
The file to be sent must be in the same directory where the server is running although you can change the access controls by modifying the code a bit. ITS EASY FOLKS>
Checked for the vulnerabilities in the program and i came to a conclusion that this porgram is FUCKING secure. PRINTF ALERT! ;).

USAGE:
The default ip address of the server is hard coded to be "192.168.1.5" , you can also change this in the def header.
 
PS:
Do not get too overwhelmed by the code. And in case you do, get a life and FUCKIN code you faggot!.
